# TradeCrew
 This project, developed last year, aimed to assist in stock analysis for managing personal investment portfolios, including Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA) and non-registered accounts. It provided features for portfolio management, stock analysis, risk assessment, performance metrics, and data visualization.
